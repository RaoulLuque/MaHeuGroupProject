Possible Conclusions:

- Greedy is way faster, and on most instances better than flow
  approach.
- Candidate paths is pretty consistently better than flow approach
- Flow approach is

For evaluation:

- Don't take into account first and last week for evaluation

Questions for Felix:

- What about vehicles that don't arrive. Can we decide how to take

- The report should be more of a report (addressing Inform for
  example / or a less general audience) or a paper (addressing a more
  general audience without any connections to the leture/project
  itself)?
